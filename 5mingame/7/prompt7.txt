Acting as an expert html5 programmer, code an HTML5 canvas game entitled Invaders. Code the html using JQuery, and Bootstrap. Please pick the dark bootstrap theme.

Make the canvas 500 pixels wide by 600 pixels in height.

Code the game logic in a separate javascript file called 'game.js'
The game consists of 20 invaders and one defender.  The invaders enter at the top left of the screen and move slowly right and left moving down 50 pixels  when they reach the right or left edge of the screen. If an invader reaches the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

Add a new invader to the screen every 1 seconds until there are 20 on the screen.

Each invader should drop a bomb every 10 seconds after the invaders creation. If the bomb hits the defender, it's game over.

When the game is over or the player wins, display the appropriate message in 40 pt text using white letters

The defender is at the bottom of the screen and moves right and left as the player depresses the right and left arrows. When the player press the space bar, it lauches a missle up. If the missile hits an invader, the invader blows up. The player wins when 20 invaders are destroyed.

The invaders, bombs, defender, and missiles all have PNG image files.
