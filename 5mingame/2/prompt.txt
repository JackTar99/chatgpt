Acting as an expert html5 programmer, code an HTML5 canvas game entitled Invaders. 

Make the canvas 500 pixels wide by 600 pixels in height.

Code the game logic in a separate javascript file called 'game.js'
The game consists of 20 invaders and one defender.  The invaders enter at the top left of the screen and move right and left moving down 100 pixels  when they reach the right or left edge of the screen. If an invader reaches the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

Add 20 invaders to the screen at a rate of one every 1.5 seconds.

Each invader should drop a bomb every 10 seconds after the invaders creation. If the bomb hits the defender, it's game over.

When the game is over or the player wins, display the appropriate message in 40 pt text.

The defender is at the bottom of the screen and moves right and left as the player depresses the right and left arrows. When the player press the space bar, it lauches a missle up. If the missile hits an invader, the invader blows up. The player wins when 20 invaders are destroyed.

The invaders, bombs, defender, and missiles all have PNG image files.
